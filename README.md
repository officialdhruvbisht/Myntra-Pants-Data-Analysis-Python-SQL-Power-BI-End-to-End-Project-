# 👖 Myntra Pants Data Analysis  
### *End-to-End Analytics Project using Python, SQL & Power BI*

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project presents a **complete end-to-end data analysis case study** on **Myntra pants category products**, designed to simulate a **real-world retail analytics problem**.

The objective is to understand **pricing behavior, discount strategies, customer ratings, and brand positioning** to generate **actionable business insights** that can help merchandising and pricing teams make informed decisions.

Instead of analyzing multiple product categories at a surface level, this project focuses **deeply on a single category (pants)** to extract **high-quality, decision-oriented insights**.

## 🎯 Business Problem  

E-commerce platforms like Myntra manage thousands of SKUs across brands and price segments.  
Key challenges include:
- Identifying **premium vs value brands**
- Understanding whether **higher discounts actually improve ratings**
- Finding **products that deliver maximum customer value**
- Optimizing **pricing and promotional strategies**

This project addresses these challenges using a structured analytics workflow.

## 🧠 Business Objectives  

- Analyze Myntra’s pants product catalog in depth  
- Segment brands into **budget, mid-range, and premium**
- Study the relationship between **price, discount, and ratings**
- Identify **best-value products** (high rating + high discount)
- Provide insights useful for **pricing, promotions, and assortment planning**

## 🔍 Analytical Approach  

The project follows a **three-phase analytics pipeline**, similar to industry workflows.

---

### 🔹 Phase 1: Python – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis  

- Loaded raw scraped Myntra product data  
- Removed duplicate records introduced during scraping  
- Handled missing values and corrected data types  
- Created meaningful derived features such as:
  - Price buckets
  - Discount buckets
  - Rating categories
- Performed exploratory analysis to understand distributions and trends  
- Exported a clean, analysis-ready dataset  

**Tools Used:**  
`Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

---

### 🔹 Phase 2: SQL – Business-Focused Analysis  

- Imported cleaned dataset into MySQL  
- Wrote optimized SQL queries to answer business questions such as:
  - Which brands are premium vs budget?
  - How do discounts vary across brands?
  - Which products offer the best value to customers?
- Applied advanced SQL concepts:
  - Aggregations & HAVING clauses
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Window functions  

**Tools Used:**  
`MySQL`
